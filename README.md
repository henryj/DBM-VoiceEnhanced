Voice Encounter Mods
=================

<h3 style="color:red;">Voice Packs</h3>
<p>With the latest release, we've changed how custom voice packs structure. Each of them will become a single addon so that you can auto update via curse. And to those who willing to help us make fun extra voice packs, now it will be much easier.</p>
<p>Existing Voice Packs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/vem-sound-neospeechpaul16">NeospeechPaul16</a> (English Male TTS)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/vem-sound-yike">Yike</a> (Chinese Female human)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/vem-sound-yun">Yun</a> (Taiwanese Female human)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/vem-sound-demo">Demo</a> (English Female TTS), This one is generated by the TTS API we used in our older versions. Now if anyone is interested in making their own voice pack, please download this one and there will be instructions in that pack soon.(still working on the details...)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>This addon is forked from the well known <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods">DBM</a> but with a different planned direction of development. It has most the functions from the original DBM plus continued <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/hudmap">HudMap</a> and various voice warnings.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will have literally voice warnings for all the critical boss abilities. </li>
<li>You will have Hud Maps for float stack points on the player.</li>
<li>You will have arrows on your screen pointing out the direction you should go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Install this Voice Encounter Mods and progress easily than ever before.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to install DBM or Hudmap or any other addons to make VEM work?</b></p>
<p>A: Nope. VEM has everything built-in. We also don't recommend that you use VEM with other encounter mods unless you know exactly what you are doing/needing.</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a way to turn up the voice?</b></p>
<p>A: Go to System -> Sound -> Volume, while keep the master volume up, turn down all the 3 sub ones (sound, music, ambience). If that doesn't work for you and you are running windows, please check your windows sound settings and turn OFF loudness equalization.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does this compatible with old modules of DBM like WotLK?</b></p>
<p>A: Sorry, you'll need the old DBM core for that. <del>There're VEM like addons with old content compatible in some way but only in Chinese I believe and legally I shouldn't talk about that here coz old DBM is not under opensource license. :))</del></p>
